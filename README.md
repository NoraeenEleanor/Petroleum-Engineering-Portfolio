# 🛢️ Petroleum Engineering Portfolio
Collection of petroleum engineering projects: gas lift, nodal analysis, petrophysics, decline curve analysis, and Power BI dashboards.
This portfolio showcases technical projects in petroleum engineering, combining domain knowledge with Python, Streamlit, Power BI, and subsurface analysis tools.

## 📁 Projects Overview

- 📉 [Decline Curve Analysis](Decline_Curve_Analysis/)    
Forecasting using exponential, harmonic, and hyperbolic models. Includes Streamlit app, CSV export, and visual plots.

- 🎯 [Dual String Gas Lift Optimization](Gas_Lift_Optimization/)  
Gas lift design and optimization for dual-string completions, with sensitivity analysis, Streamlit app, and OLGA/PROSPER comparison.

- 💧 [Nodal Analysis (Python + PROSPER)](Nodal_Analysis/)  
Single-well performance modeling using IPR and VLP. Includes Python-based nodal matching, productivity index tuning, and optional PROSPER validation.

- 🪔 [Petrophysical Analysis (LAS file)](Petrophysical_Analysis/)  
Log plotting and LAS file interpretation using Python and Streamlit. Calculates porosity, water saturation, Vshale, net pay, and generates CSV summaries.

- 📊 [Power BI + OFM Integration](Power_BI_OFM_Integration/)    
Workflow for exporting production data from OFM and visualizing field performance in Power BI. Includes data prep with Python, filtering, and auto-refresh setup.

- 🧮 [Volumetric Gas Reservoir Estimation](Volumetric_Gas_Reservoir/)  
Estimates OGIP using classical volumetric equations. Incorporates porosity, net pay, Sw, and Z-factor assumptions. Outputs include OGIP sensitivity to pressure and temperature, with CSV export.
