# ðŸŽ¯ Project 1: Dual String Gas Lift Optimization (Python + PROSPER + OLGA)

This project investigates the performance of dual string gas lift wells using a hybrid workflow with Python simulation, PROSPER modeling, and OLGA validation. The goal is to optimize gas injection rate, dome pressure, and valve configuration across both tubing strings.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `gas_lift_dual.ipynb` â€” Main Python simulation notebook
- `streamlit_app.py` â€” Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- `input_data/` â€” PVT, well test, and injection gas files
- `results/` â€” Plots and CSV outputs for sensitivity studies
- `OLGA/` â€” Sample OLGA case input and output (if available)
- `PROSPER/` â€” Snapshot of matching PROSPER models

## ðŸ§ª Parameters Explored

- Gas Injection Rate (MMscf/d)
- Dome Pressure (psig)
- Productivity Index (PI)
- Pressure Drop Between Valves (âˆ†P)
- Flow Distribution Between Tubing Strings

## ðŸ“ˆ Sensitivity Results

The study uses parametric sweep to visualize the impact of each variable on well deliverability. Outputs include:

- IPR/VLP intersection points
- Injection gas utilization efficiency
- Comparative curves: Python vs PROSPER vs OLGA

## ðŸ§  Engineering Reflection

- The simulation uses a simplified gas lift model with assumed injection profiles and fixed dome pressures.  
- Dynamic behavior such as valve hysteresis, surging, and dual string interaction is complex and was approximated manually.  
- While not fully field-calibrated, this approach demonstrates understanding of injection-response relationships and the impact of pressure drop assumptions.  
- For field application, OLGA or lift performance tests would be used to tune valve opening pressures and injection strategy.

## ðŸ”— Next Steps

To improve the workflow:
- Integrate live data into Python for real-time optimization
- Replace static gradient with pressure drop correlation (e.g. Duns & Ros)
- Add instability simulation (casing heading, density wave surging)
