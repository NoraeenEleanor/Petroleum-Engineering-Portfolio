**ðŸŽ¯ Project 1: Dual String Gas Lift Optimization (Python + PROSPER + OLGA)**  
*Engineering Reflection: Understanding Model Limitations*

The simulation uses a simplified gas lift model with assumed injection profiles and fixed dome pressures.

Dynamic behavior such as valve hysteresis, surging, and dual string interaction is complex and was approximated manually.

While not fully field-calibrated, this approach demonstrates understanding of injection-response relationships and the impact of pressure drop assumptions.

For field application, OLGA or lift performance tests would be used to tune valve opening pressures and injection strategy.
